dirvish (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Acknowledge NMU fixes.
    closes:#241084,#289026,#298833,#344203
  * Really fix the Perl warning about future reserved word, so that even
    though the warning is not given, dirvish-expire actually still does
    something :-)
    Note that the original reporter for #274943 ("does not delete backups")
    was using 1.2-1 which did not suffer from the "fix" done in the NMU, so
    tagging "unreproducible, moreinfo" was indeed appropriate.
    closes:#378903
  * Let dirvish-runall look for dirvish in /usr/sbin by default again, lost in
    the previous NMU.
    closes:#380096

  * New upstream version
  * Upstream license changed from GPL to OSL

    aware that these commands will now be run on the client as intended.
    closes:#216555
  * Fixed the example default.conf in the HOWTO.Debian and
    doc/dirvish/examples/default.conf.root to correct the xdev parameter and
    to clarify the exclude patterns.
    closes:#223023
  * Added a note to REAME.Debian that the example cron.d entry is much use if

    in that situation.
